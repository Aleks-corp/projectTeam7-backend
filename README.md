# projectTeam7 - BackEnd part

All endpoints for this Back server you can see in our
[Swagger Doc](https://projectteam7-backend.onrender.com/api-docs/).

Frameworks we used:

- **express** - manage server and routes,
- **mongoose** - Model and Schema for interaction with MongoDB,
- **multer** - middleware to interception and processing of files,
- **cloudinary** - storrage image for recipes,
- **sendgrid/mail** - to send email subscription,
- **joi** - validation body requests,
- **jsonwebtoken** - create token to authorization,
- **swagger-ui-express** - create swagger doc for work with server's endpoint.

If request takes a long time, please wait a minute and reload the page, because
owr server may go to sleep.
